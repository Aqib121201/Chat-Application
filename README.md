## 📌 Abstract

This project demonstrates a real-time chat system built with Java and Spring Boot. It uses **WebSockets** to establish bidirectional communication between users, enabling real-time message delivery. The system features a simple front-end using HTML/CSS/JS and Thymeleaf for templating. Designed for local deployment and educational exploration, it simulates the core functionalities of modern chat apps like WhatsApp or Slack in a minimal, modular codebase.

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Understand WebSocket-based communication in Java Spring Boot
- Build an end-to-end chat application with real-time capabilities
- Integrate Thymeleaf for dynamic server-side rendering
- Deploy and test a reactive messaging system locally

---

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Real-time messaging via WebSocket
- 👤 Dynamic user registration (session-based)
- 💬 Group chat / broadcast architecture
- 🖥️ Lightweight HTML/CSS/JS front-end
- 🌱 Easily extensible to private chat or persistence
